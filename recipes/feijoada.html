    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Feijoada (pronounced fay-jwa-da) is the National Dish of Brazil and what a dish it is!  In some ways you could say it’s the Brazilian version of French cassoulet in that it’s a bean dish featuring several kinds of meats.   Whereas cassoulet is made with white beans and typically includes pork sausages, goose, duck, and sometimes mutton, Feijoada is made with black beans and features a variety of pork and beef products in salted, smoked, and cured form.  The interplay of these meat flavors in feijoada makes it an exciting feast for the taste buds.</p>

    <p>Feijoada is most commonly served with sliced oranges and rice, though fried bananas and chilies are also common accompaniments.  Feijoada is made virtually everywhere in Brazil, from the humblest home to the most sophisticated restaurant in Rio.  Reflective of its popularity, some restaurants even feature a “Feijoada Day.”</p>
    
    <p>There are countless versions of feijoada with each home cook and restaurant chef using their own favorite combination of ingredients.  But a hallmark of feijoada is that it combines a variety meat products:  Fresh, cured, salted, and smoked – all thrown in together in one big pot of savory goodness. My version uses pork roast (slowly cooked in all the juices and later shredded), bacon, spicy sausage, smoked sausage, and smoked ham hocks. All of this is slow-cooked for a couple of hours with black beans and seasonings.  You’ll hardly be able to resist the mouthwatering smell emanating from your kitchen, and just wait until you taste it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry black beans</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp cooking oil <em>(I use avocado oil as it has a high smoke point but you can also use canola)</em></li>
        <li>1 pound pork shoulder <em>cleft whole and shredded at the end of cooking, or cut into chunks</em></emshoulder></li>
        <li>2 large onions , <em>sliced</em></li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic , <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>1/2 pound fresh Italian or other spicy sausage <em>casings removed and crumbled</em></li>
        <li>1/2 pound smoked sausage , <em>such as linguica or kielbasa, sliced into rounds</em></li>
        <li>1/2 pound thick sliced bacon , <em>cut into small pieces</em></li>
        <li>1 smoked ham hock</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon beef bouillon base (such as Better than Bouillon) or 3 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>hot sauce , <em>according to heat preference</em></li>
        <li>orange , <em>washed and cut into slices</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans in a large bowl of water overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy duty pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat and brown the pork shoulder until generously browned on each side. Remove the pork and set aside. In the same pan, add the bacon and cook until slightly crispy (for the best flavor leave the grease but you can drain some of it if you prefer). Add the onions and cook the onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the crumbled Italian sausage and smoked sausage and cook until the crumbled sausage is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Return the pork roast to the pot along with the smoked ham hock. Drain, rinse, and add the black beans to the pot. Add the bay leaves, black pepper, and beef bouillon base/cubes. Cover the contents of the pot with water until the meat is just barely covered (about 2 quarts). Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and let simmer for 2 hours, making sure the beans are soft. About 1 1/2 hours into the cooking time, if using whole pork roast, remove and either shred or cut it into chunks, and return to the pot.  Do the same with the meat on the smoked ham hock.</li>
        <li>If the feijoada is too liquidy, uncover the pot and continue to cook for another 20 minutes or so to allow some of the liquid to evaporate. Add more salt to taste as needed. Add some hot sauce according heat preference. Discard the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and fresh orange slices.</li>
    </ol>
