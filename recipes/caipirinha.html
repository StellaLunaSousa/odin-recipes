    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The caipirinha (kai-purr-REEN-yah) is the national drink of Brazil. It's the most popular cocktail in the South American country, and everyone has their own way of making it. Today, it is a hit worldwide and should be on every home and pro bartender's essential drink list.</p>
    <p>The basic caipirinha recipe is straightforward and requires just three ingredients: cachaça, lime, and sugar. Like the old-fashioned and mojito, this is a muddled cocktail, though the liquor of choice here is cachaça. Sometimes erroneously called Brazilian rum, it's distilled from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses. Cachaça is not as sweet as rum and has a grassy, vegetal taste that is wonderful when enhanced with the caipirinha's sweet lime flavor.</p>
    <p>A favorite summertime cocktail, the caipirinha is one of the most refreshing drinks you can mix up. It's the perfect introduction for anyone new to cachaça and an excellent way to explore and compare different brands. Plus, it can serve as inspiration for many other tasty drinks.</p>
